            This is a dual-type Grass/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
            It evolves into Ivysaur starting at level 16, which evolves into
            Venusaur starting at level 32. Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal
            amphibian Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It
            has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top
            of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of
            small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is
            open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On
            Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed
            planted there at birth. The bulb also conceals two slender,
            tentacle-like vines and provides it with energy through
            photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained
            within.

            Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. On top of its
            head are pointed ears with black insides and it has narrow red eyes.
            Ivysaur has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth and two pointed
            teeth in its upper jaw. Each of its feet has three claws on them.
            The bulb on its back has bloomed into a large pink bud. A short
            brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud.

            This is a dual-type Grass/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
            It evolves from Ivysaur starting at level 32. It is the final form
            of Bulbasaur. Venusaur is a squat, quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon
            with bumpy, blue-green skin. It has small, circular red eyes; a
            short, blunt snout; and a wide mouth with two pointed teeth in the
            upper jaw and four in the lower jaw. On top of its head are small,
            pointed ears with reddish pink insides. It has three clawed toes on
            each foot. The bud on its back has bloomed into a large pink,
            white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown
            trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur will have a seed
            in the center of its flower.

          <p>
            This is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves
            into Charmeleon starting at level 16, which evolves into Charizard
            starting at level 36. Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon
            with a primarily orange body and blue eyes. Its underside from the
            chest down and the soles of its feet are cream-colored. It has two
            small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its
            lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pokémon's slender tail
            and has blazed there since Charmander's birth. The flame can be used
            as an indication of Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly
            when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering
            when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that
            Charmander dies if its flame goes out. However, if the Pokémon is
            healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet
            and is said to steam in the rain.

            back of its head is a single horn-like protrusion. It has relatively
            long arms with three sharp claws. Its short legs have plantigrade
            feet with three claws and cream-colored soles. The tip of its long,
            powerful tail has a flame burning on it. The temperature rises to
            unbearable levels if Charmeleon swings its tail.

            primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of
            its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised
            nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of
            its rectangular head. There are two fangs visible in the upper jaw
            when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides
            sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the
            top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing-finger is visible
            through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's arms are short
            and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three
            white claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of
            its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with
            a sizable flame.

            into Wartortle starting at level 16, which evolves into Blastoise
            starting at level 36. Squirtle is a small reptilian Pokémon that
            resembles a light-blue turtle. While it typically walks on its two
            short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash
            Bros. Brawl. It has large, purplish or reddish eyes and a slightly
            hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet have three pointed
            digits. The end of its long tail curls inward. Its body is encased
            by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is
            brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white
            ridge between the two halves.

            Pokémon similar to a turtle. It has brown eyes, a dark blue streak
            on each cheek, and two sharp teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It
            has three clawed fingers and pointed toes. On each side of its head
            are feather-like ears covered in pale blue fur. A brown shell with a
            pale yellow underside encases its body. A thick, white rim separates
            the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older Wartortle may have
            scars and algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of
            the shell is a thick, wavy tail that also has light blue fur and
            cannot be fully withdrawn into its shell. Its tail fur will darken
            with age. Its tail is a popular symbol of longevity and good luck,
            making this Pokémon popular with the elderly.
