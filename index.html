            <p>
              This is a Grass-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III. It
              evolves into Grovyle starting at level 16, which evolves into
              Sceptile starting at level 36. Treecko is a small, green, bipedal
              reptilian Pokémon. It has yellow eyes with long, narrow pupils.
              Treecko's hands and feet each have three digits covered with tiny
              spikes. These spikes allow it to scale vertical walls with ease.
              Its stomach and throat are red. It also has a line across its
              stomach resembling a pouch. Treecko has a large, dark green tail
              with two separate lobes that it uses to sense humidity. This
              ability allows it to predict the next day's weather.

              This is a Grass-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III. It
              evolves from Treecko starting at level 16 and evolves into
              Sceptile starting at level 36.Grovyle is a bipedal Pokémon similar
              in appearance to a theropod dinosaur. It is primarily green with a
              red underside. There is a belt-like green stripe across its belly.
              Grovyle's hands have two clawed fingers and powerful legs with
              birdlike feet. Its well-developed muscles make it an expert
              climber and allow it to leap quickly from branch to branch.
              Grovyle has three long leaves on its wrists, a large leaf on top
              of its head, and two tails that have a leafy appearance. This
              leafy appearance allows it to be camouflaged in the forests where
              it lives. In Generation III, Leaf Blade was its signature move.

              This is a Grass-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III. It
              evolves from Grovyle starting at level 36. It is the final form of
              Treecko. Sceptile can Mega Evolve into Mega Sceptile using the
              Sceptilite. Sceptile is a reptilian, bipedal Pokémon. Its neck is
              somewhat long, and it has two crests on its head. It has
              semicircular, yellow eyes with red rims. Its lower jaw and a
              belt-like band across its waist are also red. Along its back, it
              has two lines running down the middle and two rows of yellow
              nodules that are described as seeds. Its tail is shaped similar to
              that of a palm tree's branch. Both of its long arms have two
              sharp, elongated leaves and three claws. In Generation III, Leaf
              Blade was its signature move.

              This is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III. it
              evolves into Combusken starting at level 16, which evolves into
              Blaziken starting at level 36. Torchic is a small, chick Pokémon
              with stubby, downy, yellow wings. Its body is covered with orange
              feathers. There is an orange and yellow crest on its head that
              resembles a flame. Its two thin legs and short beak are a light
              brownish yellow, and the feet have three toes in front and one in
              the back. A male Torchic will have a small black speck on its rear
              that is not present in females.

            <p>
              This is a dual-type Fire/Fighting Pokémon introduced in Generation
              III. It evolves from Torchic starting at level 16 and evolves into
              Blaziken starting at level 36. Combusken is a bipedal,
              chicken-like Pokémon. Most of Combusken's upper body is yellow,
              while most of the lower body is orange. An orange, pointed design
              adorns the center of its waist at the dividing line of the two
              colors. It has orange eyes and a short, wide beak. There is a
              feather crest on top of its head with three orange points. This
              crest is smaller on female Combusken. Its tail is short and
              pointed. It has three, sharp claws at the ends of its long arms,
              and scaly, gray legs with well-developed thighs covered in shaggy
              feathers. Because of the training Combusken does by running
              through its grassland habitat, these legs are capable of
              delivering a barrage of kicks. While it is fighting, it is noisy
              and produces sharp cries that distract and intimidate its
              opponent.

              using the Blazikenite. Blaziken is a bipedal, chicken-like
              Pokémon. The majority of Blaziken's body is red with accents of
              beige, yellow, and gray. Behind its head, there are beige,
              hair-like feathers that continue downward and surround its chest
              and abdomen. It has a small red face with a V-shaped crest on its
              head. Blaziken's blue eyes are semicircular with yellow sclerae,
              and its mouth is similar to a hooked beak. It has featherless,
              gray hands with three fingers each, and three clawed toes that are
              not normally visible due to the shaggy, yellow feathers on the
              bottom of its legs. A female has a shorter mask and hair than a
              male.

              quadrupedal Pokémon. It has a blue body with a light-blue
              underside. Mudkip has a large head with a blue fin on top and a
              light-blue tail fin. It has black, beady eyes and orange,
              star-shaped gills on its cheeks. By using the fin on its head,
              Mudkip can detect changes in air and water currents as well as
              bodies of water. Its fin can also point in a certain direction, as
              seen in the anime. Mudkip is capable of moving or crushing
              boulders larger than itself.

            <p>
              This is a dual-type Water/Ground Pokémon introduced in Generation
              III. It evolves from Mudkip starting at level 16 and evolves into
              Swampert starting at level 36. Marshtomp is an amphibious, bipedal
              Pokémon. Its body is primarily light-blue with a lighter shade of
              blue for its underside and an orange belly. Marshtomp's head has
              an angular black fin, orange eyes, and orange gills on the ends of
              both cheeks. It has long arms with three-fingered hands. Its feet
              have three small toes, and it has two black fins for tails. This
              Pokémon has a thin, sticky film enveloping its body that enables
              it to live on land. Its body weakens if its skin dries out, so it
              plays in the mud on beaches when the tide is low to replenish
              fluids. It is capable of moving faster through mud than water.
              With its sturdy legs, it has a good footing in mud that allows it
              to overwhelm struggling opponents. In Generation III, Muddy Water
              was its signature move. Marshtomp lives in swamps and other
              wetlands.

              III. It evolves from Marshtomp starting at level 36. It is the
              final form of Mudkip. Swampert can Mega Evolve into Mega Swampert
              using the Swampertite. Swampert is an amphibian-like Pokémon with
              a bulky frame and four thick limbs, the two longer ones at the
              front serving as arms while the shorter limbs provide support for
              the creature if it chooses to stand upright. Swampert is
              semi-bipedal. It can stand on its three-toed feet with a hunched
              posture, and pick up or grab objects with its hands, but when
              moving about it tends to run on all four limbs. It has orange
              conical gills that protrude from round patches on either side of
              its face. Two large fan-like black fins extend from the top of its
              orange eyes to the back of its head. Similarly, a black fan-like
              tail fin extends upward from its hindquarters. Swampert is
              predominantly cobalt with a white abdomen, orange gills, and
              similarly orange padding on all four limbs.
